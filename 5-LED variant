(note: 'in' is the LED's input, not what the MCU sees as the input.  i.e. LED 1
is sourced by pin 7 and sunk by pins 2, 6 and 5.)

So far I can get 5 LEDs off of the 5 pins - I really end up needing a dedicated
anode/cathode pin per LED, unfortunately.  That means the (theoretical) 6th LED
is unfeasible unless if I get a HVSP and use RSTDISBL to change RESET into PB5.
Feh.

Easiest layout (tested)
in out - led color
 7   2 - 1   r
 7   6 - 1   g
 7   5 - 1   b
 6   7 - 2   r
 6   5 - 2   g
 6   3 - 2   b
 5   6 - 3   r
 5   3 - 3   g
 5   2 - 3   b
 3   5 - 4   r
 3   2 - 4   g
 3   7 - 4   b
 2   3 - 5   r
 2   7 - 5   g
 2   6 - 5   b

If you work it out, that lays out on a circuit board on one side without any
crossing.  You could conceivably do this board single-sided with 1 air wire.
